# ENGO-551-Lab-3
An extension of Lab 2, essentially.
So first off, I used a new background to go with the theme of the mapbox map. You can switch between the old and new map by clicking the button that says click here. When you click it it goes back to the old, now seemingly ugly map. The "Select the Traffic..." div that contains the form to change layers also disappears. When you click the button again the map goes to the basemap of the new map and the div containing the form to change layers comes back. From this form you can switch between multiple layers. Each of the layers with traffic data have a heat map associated with them to make them look better.
The csv file used was editted using powerQuery on excel to add another field so that I could differentiate between incidents involving and not involving vehicles. That was done by seeing if the word vehicle was used in the desciption or not. I used small circles with a bold outline to show each point and the heat map was made to be fairly transparent (low opacity) so that the points stuck out more. Also, the radius and intensity for the heat map was low for all and vehicle related layers because otherwise it wouldn't really tell us much, and only be a blur. It was slightly higher in the layer with the non-vehicle data because that data wasn't as dense so it needed more intensity and a higher radius for us to see anything. Anything not mentioned here is commented in the code or explained in the video. Thank you!
